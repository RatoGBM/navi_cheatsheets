My cheatsheets for [navi](https://github.com/denisidoro/navi).

My cheatsheets help when "I need a tool for X but I forgot what it is called." (unlike other navi cheatsheets which are mostly shortcuts for common commands.)

Cons: My cheatsheets won't work unless you install the tools (which you should, because they are great.) I put links to repos in the comments next to the cheatsheet entries.

Enjoy!
